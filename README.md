3) How to Use: 
Each folder corresponds to a DSA topic and contains relevant problems and solutions. Navigate to the desired topic to find the associated code.

4)Topics Covered: 
ArrayList: Dynamic arrays in Java, CRUD operations, common pitfalls.
Arrays: Basic operations, traversals, sorting algorithms, searching techniques.
Assignment: Mixed DSA problems assigned across various topics for practice.
Backtracking: Recursive backtracking solutions like N-Queens, Sudoku, Rat in a Maze.
Basics: Java syntax, input/output, loops, conditionals, data types.
BinaryTree: Tree creation, traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder), depth/height.
BitManipulation: Binary operations, power of two, XOR problems, set/unset bits.
BST (Binary Search Tree): Insertion, deletion, search, floor/ceil, range queries.
Divide & Conquer: Problems solved using the DnC paradigm like merge sort, inversion count.
DP (Dynamic Programming): Memoization and tabulation approaches for classic DP problems.
Graphs: Graph representation, traversal (BFS, DFS), cycle detection, connected components.
Greedy: Interval scheduling, activity selection, coin change, Huffman encoding.
Hashing: HashMaps, HashSets, frequency maps, hashing-based problem solving.
Heaps: Min-Heap/Max-Heap, priority queue, heap sort, top-K elements problems.
LinkedList: Singly and doubly linked list operations, cycle detection, reverse LL.
